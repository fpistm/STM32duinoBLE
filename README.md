# STM32duinoBLE

This library is a fork of ArduinoBLE library to add the support of SPBTLE-RF, SPBTLE-1S, BLUENRG-M2SP, BLUENRG-LP and BLUENRG-M0 BLE modules.

It was successfully tested with the [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2] or [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1] or [X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1] expansion board and a [NUCLEO-F401RE] or [NUCLEO-L476RG] or [NUCLEO-L053R8], with [B-L475E-IOT01A], [B-L4S5I-IOT01A], [STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1], [STEVAL-MKBOXPRO] and with [STM32L562E-DK].

 - In order to use this library with [STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1], you need to update the firmware of the SPBTLE-1S BLE module mounted on that board as described in the following wiki page:

https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32/wiki/STM32duinoBLE#stm32duinoble-with-steval_mksbox1v1

- In order to use this library with X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1, you need to update the firmware of the BLUENRG-M2SP BLE module mounted on that expansion board as described in the following wiki page:

# Configuration

### Shield

The user can include the file `ble_spi_conf.h` to define which shield and configuration to use from the following list:

 * [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2]
    * `IDB05A2_SPI_CLOCK_D3`: SPI clock on D3
    * `IDB05A2_SPI_CLOCK_D13` SPI clock on D13
 * [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1]
    * `IDB05A1_SPI_CLOCK_D3`: SPI clock on D3
    * `IDB05A1_SPI_CLOCK_D13`: SPI clock on D13
 * [X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1]
    * `BNRG2A1_SPI_CLOCK_D3`: SPI clock on D3
    * `BNRG2A1_SPI_CLOCK_D13`: SPI clock on D13
 * `CUSTOM_BLE_SPI`: define a custom configuration, it requires below definition:
    * `BLE_SPI_MISO`: SPI MISO pin
    * `BLE_SPI_MOSI`: SPI MOSI pin
    * `BLE_SPI_CLK`: SPI CLocK pin
    * `BLE_SPI_CS`: SPI Chip Select pin
    * `BLE_SPI_IRQ`: SPI IRQ pin
    * `BLE_SPI_FREQ`: SPI bus frequency
    * `BLE_SPI_MODE`: can be one of the below `SPIMode`:
      * `SPI_MODE0`
      * `SPI_MODE1`
      * `SPI_MODE2`
      * `SPI_MODE0`
    * `BLE_CHIP_TYPE`: can be one of the below `BLEChip_t`:
      * `SPBTLE_RF`
      * `SPBTLE_1S`
      * `BLUENRG_M2SP`
      * `BLUENRG_M0`
      * `BLUENRG_LP`
    * `BLE_RESET`: BLE reset pin

#### Examples

To use the [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2] with SPI clock on D3, define in `ble_spi_conf.h`:
```C
#define IDB05A2_SPI_CLOCK_D3
```
This is equivalent to the below configuration using the `CUSTOM_BLE_SPI`:
```C
#define CUSTOM_BLE_SPI
#define BLE_SPI_MISO    D12
#define BLE_SPI_MOSI    D11
#define BLE_SPI_CLK     D3
#define BLE_SPI_CS      A1
#define BLE_SPI_IRQ     A0
#define BLE_SPI_FREQ    8000000
#define BLE_SPI_MODE    SPI_MODE0
#define BLE_CHIP_TYPE   BLUENRG_M0
#define BLE_RESET       D7
```
