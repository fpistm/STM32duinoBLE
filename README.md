# STM32duinoBLE

This library is a fork of ArduinoBLE library to add the support of SPBTLE-RF, SPBTLE-1S, BLUENRG-M2SP, BLUENRG-LP and BLUENRG-M0 BLE modules.

It was successfully tested with the [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A2] or [X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1] or [X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1] expansion board and a [NUCLEO-F401RE] or [NUCLEO-L476RG] or [NUCLEO-L053R8], with [B-L475E-IOT01A], [B-L4S5I-IOT01A], [STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1], [STEVAL-MKBOXPRO] and with [STM32L562E-DK].

 - In order to use this library with [STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1], you need to update the firmware of the SPBTLE-1S BLE module mounted on that board as described in the following wiki page:

- In order to use this library with X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1, you need to update the firmware of the BLUENRG-M2SP BLE module mounted on that expansion board as described in the following wiki page:
